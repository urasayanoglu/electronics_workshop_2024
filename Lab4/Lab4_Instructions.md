LAB 4 – Twillight Switch 
========================

## Description:

Photo resistors are light sensitive devices most often used to indicate the presence or absence of light, or to measure the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very high, sometimes up to 1 MΩ, but when the LDR sensor is exposed to light the resistance drops to a few ohms, depending on the light intensity.

## Part A 

- When the night falls you need light. So build a twilight switch using LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and use LED as a light source. First step is make the switch work with ON/OFF principle. 

## Part B  

- Add to the circuit a suitable variable resistor so that you can change the level of the lighting where the LED lights up. 

## Part C 

- This part is only for participants of programming microcontrollers and not for participants of basics of programming microcontrollers. 

- When the room is going to be darker you need light but there is no need for maximum brightness at once from the light source. Modify the circuit and the programming code of the part B so that the brightness of the light source changes with the darkness of the room. You can use same kind of changeable frequency for blinking LEDs as in the Task 3 or you can use analogWrite() function to change the brightness of the light source as in link
