LAB 1 – Set up the toolset, create a LED blinker 
================================================

## Task 1: Installing the IDE

A development environment is required to carry out this course. There are several alternatives: available:

| SW Platform   | Difficulty   | Link   |
|:------------- |:------------ |:------ |
| Arduino IDE   | Beginner     | https://www.arduino.cc/ |
| VSCode with PlatformIO | Intermediate | https://platformio.org/ |
| ESP IDF       | Advanced | [ESP IoT Development Framework Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf) |

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are several hardware platform options available for you to use:</p>


| HW Platform   | Difficulty   | Link   |
|:------------- |:------------ |:------ |
| Arduino Uno / RedBoard | Beginner     | https://www.arduino.cc/ |
| ESP32, several versions available  | Intermediate | [ESP IoT Development Framework Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf) |

1. Download and install Arduino IDE and C/C++ compiler to your laptop.  

2. Alternatively you can use VSCode + PlatformIO, see this: [ESP32 + VSCode + PlatformIO  (Web view)](https://tuas365.sharepoint.com/sites/ElectronicsWorkshop/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={76eb9d2f-5771-4168-a860-581e347eff67}&action=view&wd=target%28_Content%20Library%2FESP32%20material.one%7Cc016ae6a-3dc7-4fad-9bfa-2e2e20ec5d70%2FESP32%20%2B%20VSCode%20%2B%20PlatformIO%7Cd047221b-2c87-4ffe-b453-192083b0ad52%2F%29&wdorigin=703) 

3. Find TinkerCad-page from web and familiarize yourself with it. 

4. First test you design with TinkerCad (at home) so that your circuit and program work properly. 

5. Do the same circuit in the laboratory and check how it work with true components. 

6. Demonstrate a working set-up to the teacher. ALternatively, record a video showing your system is working. 

## Task 2: Test that Arduino IDE is working properly with the program Blink. 

Program "Blink" is in the examples of Arduino.

Make needed circuit with LED to the breadboard. 

> **Important:** Remember that LED always needs a series resistor (resistance about 300 Ω).
