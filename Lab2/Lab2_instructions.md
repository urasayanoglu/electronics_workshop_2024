LAB 2 – Morse code generator 
============================

## Description:

Re-read if necessary [Arduino Lesson 1 - Blink](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-1-blink)

Re-read if necessary [Arduino Lesson 2 - Leds](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-2-leds) 

**Remember** that LED always needs a series resistor (resistance about **300 Ω**). 

**Everyone** does parts **A** and **B**

## Part A 

- Make similar circuit with LED to the breadboard as in the Lesson 1. 

- Connect the circuit to the Arduino and make program that blinks continuously the International Morse code distress signal (SOS, …---…) with LED. 

- Read [Arduino Lesson 6 - Digital Inputs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-6-digital-inputs/push-switches) 

- Read [Tactile switch and LED](https://www.buildcircuit.com/arduino-project-7-button-tactile-switch-and-led/) 

 

**NOTE:** The instructions above are missing the 220 ohm LED series resistor! Remember to add it!

## Part B 

- Make a circuit so that you can make morse signals to the LED directly with the Tactile push switch without needing to use a program. 

- Make a circuit so that you can make morse signals to the LED so that Arduino code is controlling the LED and reading the Tactile push switch. 

## Part C 

- This part is only for participants of programming microcontrollers and not for participants of basics of programming microcontrollers. 

- Modify circuit and program so that you can choose the continuously SOS or sending your own morse code. 

- The statement above gives you quite much of freedom how to implement it. 

- Pay attention to the reliability and elegancy of the programming code (and circuit).
