Electronics Workshop
====================

## Introduction 

In this course, we will focus on hands-on programming of microcontrollers. The emphasis is on laboratory work, and it is possible to tailor to content to match the skill level of students, even individually. 

We have in total 10 lab sessions, during which you should be able to complete 8 lab exercises.  

## Grading 

The grading of the course is based on completed number of exercises:

|  Labs Completed | Grade |
|:--------------- |:----- |
| <4              | 0     |
| 4               | 1     |
| 5               | 2     |
| 6               | 3     |
| 7               | 4     |
| 8               | 5     |

If separately agreed, a student (or group of students) can  work on a more advanced topic, which would then replace several lab exercises. In these cases, it is expected that the student and/or student group has a clear evidence of the amount of completed work (=Git repository with sufficient amount of activity), and is ready to demonstrate/present that to other students during a "Demo Day".

There will be no **exam**.
