LAB 7 â€“ RGB LED Controller 
==========================

## Description:

In this lesson, you will learn about use of a potentiometer and use of it to control the brightness of different colors of an RGB LED. 

 To help you get started: 

- [Analog Inputs](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-8-analog-inputs/an-experiment) 

- [Make an RGB Led Fader](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-arduino-lesson-7-make-an-rgb-led-fader/overview)


Ask for an RGB LED from the instructor. 


### Part A: 

Build a circuit using a potentiometer and an RGB LED (or three separate LEDs) with series resistors. Make program that reads voltage from the potentiometer and defines from the voltage which color (red, green or blue) is turned on. You can define the thresholds yourself. 


### Part B (For basics of programming microcontrollers): 

 
Build a circuit using a potentiometer, tactile push switches and an RGB LED (or three separate LEDs) with series resistors. The switches should define which color (red, green or blue) brightness is controlled by the potentiometer. Note that all of the colors could be on at the same time. 


### Part C (For programming microcontrollers): 

 
Build a circuit using a potentiometer, tactile push switches and an RGB LED (or three separate LEDs) with series resistors. The switches should define which color (red, green or blue) brightness is controlled by the potentiometer. Note that all of the colors could be on at the same time. Use LCD display to show which of color brightness could be changed at this moment and what is the voltage on the potentiometer. 

  
### Extra mile: 

Use WS2812 / NeoPixel bus-programmable RGB-LED for the tasks above.
